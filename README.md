# Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction
**Predicting survival with machine learning algorithms has gained much attention nowadays, and it is widely applied in the healthcare industry. With a strong interest in the healthcare industry and a curiosity on what kind of features can be used to predict survival, I finished this Titanic Survival Prediction project on Kaggle.** 

**In this project, I went through the whole cycle of machine learning, which can be summarized into steps below:**

  **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  **2. Data Cleaning, Feature Selection & Engineering**
  
  **3. Modeling and Predicting with 5 Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  
  _Logistic Regression_
  
  _K-Nearest Neighbors_
  
  _Decision Tree_
  
  _Random Forest_
  
  _XGBoost_

  **4. Results Comparing and Picking the Best Model**
  
**Among the 5 algorithms, surprisingly _Decision Tree_ had the best accuracy of almost 79% applied on testing data. To me, this is a very good score since I can accurately predict the survival for 79 passengers given 100 passengers in total.** 

**However, there is still much room for improvement. For example, I replaced all the missing values in Age with the mean value. If the missing values were imputed based on other features, our model's accuracy may be higher.** 

**I really enjoyed spending hours on this project and hope my thoughts & codes could offer new insights to anyone who sees this!**

Thanks!
