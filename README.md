# Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction
**Predicting survival with machine learning algorithms has gained much attention nowadays, and it is widely applied in the healthcare industry. With a strong interest in the healthcare industry and a curiosity on what kind of features can be used to predict survival, I finished this Titanic Survival Prediction project on Kaggle.** 

**In this project, I went through the whole cycle of machine learning, which can be summarized into steps below:**

  **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  **2. Data Cleaning, Feature Selection & Engineering**
  
  **3. Modeling and Predicting with 5 Types of Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  
  _Logistic Regression_
  
  _K-Nearest Neighbors_
  
  _Decision Tree_
  
  _Random Forest_
  
  _XGBoost_

  **4. Results Comparing and Picking the Best Model**
